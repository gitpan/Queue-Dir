SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

I have no control on the machanisms involved in the storage or
transport of this distribution. This means that I cannot guarantee
that the distribution you have in your hands is indeed, the same
distribution I packed and uploaded.

Along the distribution file, you should have a file with the extension
".asc". This contains a GPG "detached signature" that makes it
impossible for anybody to alter this distribution. If security is of
any concern to you, by all means verify the signature of this file and
contact the author if any discrepancy is detected.
